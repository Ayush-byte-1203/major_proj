# 🌐 Netlify Deployment Guide

## **Frontend Deployment to Netlify**

This project has a Python backend and HTML/CSS/JS frontend. Only the frontend is deployed to Netlify.

### **Deployment Steps:**

1. **Go to [Netlify](https://netlify.com)**
2. **Click "New site from Git"**
3. **Connect your GitHub repository**: `Ayush-byte-1203/major_proj`
4. **Set build settings:**
   - **Build command**: `echo 'Frontend already built'`
   - **Publish directory**: `frontend`
5. **Click "Deploy site"**

### **Important Notes:**

- ⚠️ **Backend API calls will fail** on Netlify (no Python server)
- 🔧 **Frontend will work** but won't connect to backend
- 📱 **Perfect for frontend testing** and UI development
- 🚀 **Use for demo purposes** and frontend showcase

### **Alternative Deployment Options:**

1. **Vercel** - Similar to Netlify, good for frontend
2. **Heroku** - Full-stack deployment (Python + Frontend)
3. **Railway** - Modern full-stack platform
4. **Render** - Good for Python applications

### **For Full-Stack Deployment:**

Consider deploying the entire project to:
- **Heroku** (Python + Frontend)
- **Railway** (Full-stack)
- **Render** (Python apps)

### **Current Status:**

✅ **Frontend**: Ready for Netlify deployment  
⚠️ **Backend**: Needs separate Python hosting  
🔗 **Database**: Uses localStorage (client-side only)
