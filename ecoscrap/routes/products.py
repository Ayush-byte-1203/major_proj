EcoScrap Application - Product Routes
=====================================

This module contains all product-related routes for the EcoScrap application.
It handles product creation, management, approval workflow, and marketplace operations.

Routes Included:
- GET /api/products: List products with filtering and search
- POST /api/products: Create new product (dealers only)
- PUT/DELETE /api/products/<id>: Update or delete products
- POST /api/admin/products/<id>/approve: Approve products (admins only)
- POST /api/admin/products/<id>/reject: Reject products (admins only)

Product Features:
- Marketplace product listings
- Product approval workflow
- Category-based filtering
- Search functionality
- Stock management
- Dealer product management

Business Logic:
- Only dealers can create products
- Products require admin approval before marketplace visibility
- Stock validation prevents overselling
- Product status management (pending, approved, rejected)

Security Features:
- Role-based access control
- Input validation and sanitization
- Ownership verification for modifications
- Admin-only approval operations

    Get all approved products with optional filtering
    
    This endpoint retrieves products from the marketplace with various
    filtering options. By default, only approved products are returned,
    but admins can view all products regardless of status.
    
    Query Parameters:
        - category: Filter by product category
        - search: Search in product names, descriptions, and dealer names
        - status: Filter by product status (default: approved)
        - limit: Maximum number of products to return
        - offset: Number of products to skip for pagination
    
    Filtering Logic:
        - Category filtering: Exact match on product category
        - Search filtering: Case-insensitive search across multiple fields
        - Status filtering: Filter by approval status
        - Pagination: Limit and offset for large result sets
    
    Business Rules:
        - Customers see only approved products
